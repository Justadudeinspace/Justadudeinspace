## **Proloque**

> 
> In the beginning, there was one man who stood alone against all odds. Lost in the vast darkness between space and time with no aid, support, or help of any kind, *JADIS* found himself facing a situation with no hope of rescue, no solution of victory, and no means of escape. 
> 
> With the odds stacked against him no matter what decision he makes, he pushes foward into the all encompassing vacuum of what is sure to be death. Accepting his fate knowing that the outcome will result the same no matter what choice he makes, he let's go of trying to control what is.
> 
> *What will happen to this lost soul?*
