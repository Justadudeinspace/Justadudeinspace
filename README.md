# 👋 Hi, I’m **JADIS** (Christopher Osburn)

**Systems Architect | Software Developer | Open-Source Orchestrator**

I design and build **practical, auditable systems** — not demos, not abstractions.  
My focus is on **AI orchestration, ethical governance, developer tooling, and transparent automation** that can *run anywhere* (including Termux and constrained environments).

I contribute by:
- fixing issues directly with disciplined, patch-first workflows  
- improving architecture, docs, and automation ergonomics  
- hardening security with transparent audit trails and governance  

My systems are optimized for **clarity, sovereignty, and verifiable behavior**.

## 🌌 Outer Void — Open-Source Constellation
🔗 https://github.com/Outer-Void

Outer Void is the umbrella ecosystem that **houses the BLUX system** — a unified framework for AI orchestration, governance, security, and developer automation. 4

## 🧠 BLUX System — Unified Architecture

The **BLUX system** is a modular AI + tooling platform designed around:
- **privacy-first operation**
- **auditability & immutable logs**
- **intelligent orchestration**
- **ethical governance**
- **transparent CLI/TUI interfaces**

It is engineered as a **coherent ecosystem**, not a collection of disconnected repos. 5

### Core BLUX Modules

| Project | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **[BLUX Ecosystem](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-ecosystem)** | Central orchestration hub — defines contracts, identity, trust flows, and governance for the entire ecosystem. 6 |
| **[BLUX-Lite](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-lite)** | Local-first AI orchestrator — intelligent routing, privacy-first model selection, append-only audit logs, and modular plugins. 7 |
| **[BLUX-cA](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-ca)** | Clarity Agent — constitutional, audit-driven AI helm that interprets intent, enforces governance, and routes tasks safely across models and tools. 8 |
| **[BLUX-Guard](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-guard)** | Security cockpit — non-root, transparent monitoring of processes, packages, and permissions with zero-trust defaults. 9 |
| **[BLUX-Reg](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-reg)** | Registry & trust kernel — identity, key management, provenance, and audit integration. 10 |
| **[BLUX-Quantum](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-quantum)** | Unified CLI/TUI interface (`bluxq`) — single entrypoint for orchestrating and interacting with BLUX modules. 11 |
| **[BLUX-Commander](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-commander)** | Web cockpit — dashboard and cross-module UI interaction (early UI stage). 12 |

## 🛠 Developer Tooling 

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [**DAT**](https://github.com/Outer-Void/dat) | Dev Audit Tool — scans codebases into structured documentation and reports. |
| [**LRC**](https://github.com/Outer-Void/lrc) | Local Repo Compiler — generates complete repo structures from declarative schema definitions. |
| [**DAT-Scan**](https://github.com/Outer-Void/dat-scan) | *(WIP)* Advanced scan and diagnostics companion for DAT outputs. |

## 💡 Philosophy

> **“From the void, I build systems that think, protect, and reflect.”**

Aligned with:
- **privacy first** — local-first, no unwarranted cloud dependence  
- **auditability** — immutable trail of decisions and actions
